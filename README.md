# Media Folders Lite

Media Folders Lite is a simple solution that gives WordPress the ability to create a real custom upload path for your attachments. Also in WP Media Library you can filter them by folders.

## Why?

Because the default WordPress media file paths are not very good. You can opt for year and month folders which may seem useful if you are reusing content but affect SEO. The other option is to put all the files in a folder that doesn't scale when you start to have a lot of files.

Too many files in a folder can cause performance issues on file systems like EXT4. If all your files are in the same folder, you will also run into file name conflicts.

## Media Folders Lite - Features
